            users?"
          </li>
          <li>
            "Do users only read one language, should we deactivate the others?"
          </li>
          <li>"How long do users stay on individual sections of the site?"</li>
          <li>"Should we add a scroll-to-top button?"</li>
          <li>"Do people really try that button at the end?"</li>
        </ul>
        ...don't always have a definite answer. For solid arguments, UX data and
        its interpretation will help you build better UIs
        <h2>The Product/Service perspective</h2>
        We want to include non-technical people in our teams, who mostly see the
        pages like the users do. With this "product perspective" we can inspect
        the invisible side of the page we're testing
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i data-qa-id="highlighted element">(s)</i> are the ones which
            trigger UX events inside the user's page, which helps us understand
            analytics data better
          </li>
          <li>
            The "wrapped" page included below <b>doesn't trigger</b> UX events.
            Analysing the wrapped page will not mess with the data
          </li>
          <li>It shows the same ids that are being used for QA testing</li>
          <li>
            This does <b>not</b> require additional code inside the page we're
            testing
          </li>
        </ul>
        Below you can scroll all the way down to the button, which is also
        highlighted.
